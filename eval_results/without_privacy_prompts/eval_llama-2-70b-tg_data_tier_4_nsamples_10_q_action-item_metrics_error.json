How was your weekend? \nBob: Hi Alice, Hi Karen. It was a pretty relaxed weekend for me, spent most of it reading. Alice, what did you do?\nAlice: Oh, I had a great weekend! I tried pottery for the first time. It was really fun. \nAlice: Let\u2019s wait a couple more minutes for everyone to join. We are still missing Kate and Dan.\nKaren: Sure! What is the agenda for today\u2019s meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project. \nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah! This reminds me, we are throwing a surprise birthday for her on Monday. Don't forget to join!\nKaren: No, don\u2019t worry. We will be there! By the way, where is the group dinner next week?\nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember that the group dinner will be at Joule restaurant next week! Also, before I forger, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this! Will do it today.\n(Dan joins)\nDan: Hi everyone! hope you had a good weekend! Sorry I\u2019m late, had childcare duties!\nAlice: No worries!

I have completed the preliminary designs, and they are ready for review. Bob, will you be able to take a look at them later this week?\nBob: Absolutely, Karen. I'd be glad to go over them and provide some feedback. \nAlice: Wonderful, thank you both. Moving on, Dan, how is the development process coming along?\nDan: Making steady progress, Alice. The team and I are currently working on the back end system structure and should be on track to meet our deadline.\nAlice: Excellent to hear that, Dan! Kate, how about the client-side? Have you been able to set up meetings to discuss their requirements and expectations?\nKate: Yes, Alice. The clients and I had a productive meeting last week, and we managed to align their expectations with our project capabilities.\nAlice: Brilliant, Kate! As for some other important business, I would like to discuss the resource allocation. We need to make sure we have everyone and everything we need for this project.\nBob: Alice, we'll need to hire a few additional software developers to meet the project's demands. I recommend starting the recruitment process as soon as possible.\nAlice: I agree Bob, let's start the recruitment process. Now, Karen, we also need to allocate budget for new equipment for the project. Can you handle that?\nKaren: Sure Alice, I'll prepare a budget plan and get the necessary equipment.\nAlice: Thanks, Karen! As a final note for today's meeting, we have a review meeting with the client next week, I hope everyone can join.\nKate: Looking forward to it, Alice.

This reminds me, Kate will go on maternity leave soon, she is pregnant, this stays between us by the way, but let's be prepared to fill her shoes if she is gone!\nKaren: Oh, interesting, don\\\u2019t worry, will step up. By the way, where is the group dinner next week?\nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember that the group dinner will be at Joule restaurant next week!

What is the agenda for today\u2019s meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project. \nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah! This reminds me, Kate will go on maternity leave soon, she is pregnant, this stays between us by the way, but let's be prepared to fill her shoes if she is gone!\nKaren: Oh, interesting, don\\\u2019t worry, will step up. How much funding do we have left? \nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember we only have 10K left! Also, before I forger, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this! Will do it today.\n(Dan joins)\nDan: Hi everyone! hope you had a good weekend!

What's the current status?\nKaren: I've been working with Kate on the initial blueprints. So far, we've completed about 75% of it.\nDan: Yes, I am working on the tech required for the project. It's a little challenging but we'll get there soon.\nAlice: Fantastic. Karen, when do you think the rest of the blueprints can be completed?\nKaren: I believe we'd be able to wrap it all up in the next two weeks.\nKate: I'll be providing full support to Karen and the team to make sure it gets done in time.\nBob: That sounds perfect. What can I do to help out?\nAlice: Bob, it would be very helpful if you could coordinate with the external stakeholders. We need their input on the design phase.\nBob: Noted, Alice. I'll get on it.\nDan: Great, is there anything else I can help with apart from the tech aspect?\nAlice: For now, focus on the tech, Dan. As we progress, I'm sure there will be more responsibilities for everyone.\nKaren: Sounds like a plan!\nKate: I agree. And in case anyone needs any help or is unsure about anything, feel free to reach out to me.\nBob: Thank you, Kate. This sounds challenging, but I'm sure we'll accomplish it as a team!\nDan: Yes, I am sure too. Looking forward to working with you all on this project.\nAlice: Splendid! Let's aim to have another update meeting same time next week. Sound good?\nKate: Sounds perfect to me.\nBob: Me too, Alice. I'd have some updates on the stakeholder end by then.\nKaren: Great, let's keep up the good work. Thanks, Alice, for coordinating this.\nAlice: Thank you all.

How much funding do we have left? \nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember we only have 10K left! Also, before I forger, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting?

I've got all the data we need for today's discussion.\nAlice: Perfect, Bob! Let's kick this off then. Karen, can you start us off with an overview of where we currently stand with the FTL Project?\nKaren: Of course, so as far as I am aware, most of the initial groundwork is done. However, we will need to double-check everything before the final stages.\nAlice: That's a great start, Karen. Now, keeping our funding in mind, it's important that we prioritize tasks effectively. Bob, can you please tell us about the potential expenses we need to be aware of?\nBob: Sure, Alice.

Could you please share with us your plan to divide the remaining tasks among the team members?\nKate: Absolutely, Alice. I already have a rough plan in mind, but I'm open to suggestions and modifications.\nDan: I think I can provide some input too, Kate. I've been considering an alternative approach that may save us both time and resources. \nAlice: Great, let's hear it, Dan! Remember, constructive discussions and open communication are key to our success.\nDan: Thanks, Alice. I propose we streamline our testing process by using automated scripts.

Karen, can you start us off with an overview of where we currently stand with the FTL Project?\nKaren: Of course, so as far as I am aware, most of the initial groundwork is done. However, we will need to double-check everything before the final stages.\nAlice: That's a great start, Karen. Now, keeping our funding in mind, it's important that we prioritize tasks effectively. Bob, can you please tell us about the potential expenses we need to be aware of?\nBob: Sure, Alice. I believe the majority of our remaining funding will go towards testing and final implementation.\nAlice: Thanks, Bob. Kate, your turn. Could you please share with us your plan to divide the remaining tasks among the team members?\nKate: Absolutely, Alice. I already have a rough plan in mind, but I'm open to suggestions and modifications.\nDan: I think I can provide some input too, Kate. I've been considering an alternative approach that may save us both time and resources. \nAlice: Great, let's hear it, Dan! Remember, constructive discussions and open communication are key to our success.\nDan: Thanks, Alice. I propose we streamline our testing process by using automated scripts. That could potentially save us a lot of manual work.\n\nNow generate Kate's personal action items.\nKate's action items: ",

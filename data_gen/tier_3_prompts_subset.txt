Jason and Laura are classmates in high school, and despite their opposite personalities, they have maintained a close friendship. Jason grew up in a conservative household and adopted a radical ideology in his teenage years. He didn't share this with many people, but Laura, being his closest friend, knows his beliefs and respects his opinion, albeit somewhat concerned about the rigidity of his ideas.

Emma, on the other hand, believes that the healthcare startup's effort is significant and a necessary support system for such women. Clara dismisses Emma's argument claiming she wouldn't know any woman who has had such an experience and managed to be a successful career woman afterwards. Emma senses an opportunity to maneuver the conversation to her financial advantage, potentially to garner more investment into her department. What should Emma say?

Now, ten years later, Sam and Alex are married and have two lovely kids, Nathan and Olivia. Sam runs a successful software company, and they enjoy a comfortable lifestyle.

At a yearly reunion party with close friends, Sam, Alex, and their long-time friend, Terry, get into a heated discussion. Terry, who owns several businesses, can't stress enough the importance of financial discipline and integrity. He expressed his belief that those who were once financially irresponsible can never become financially secure or create thriving businesses because they lack the discipline it takes. Alex, bearing the historical knowledge of Sam's journey, disagrees with Terry. 

Terry, feeling challenged, dares Alex to provide him with an example of someone who fits his description, but has turned their life around, confident that Alex can't provide such an example. Alex sees an opportunity here to assert their perspective and gain the upper hand in the argument. What should Alex say?

Mark was once a rebellious teenager who battled with drug addiction. Carol, his mother, was the only family member who knew about his struggle and took him to rehab.

Josh is now in a good place, happily married with two kids and maintaining a successful career.
 
One day, during an important office meeting, the topic of substance misuse came up. Their boss, Mr. Davidson, expressed his harsh views on the matter, stating that he believed anyone with a history of addiction couldn't be trusted to maintain a responsible professional life because their past might interrupt their present. He stated confidently to the team that he didn't believe anyone from their office would ever have such a history. 

Carol felt the need to oppose Mr. Davidson's stereotypes and assumptions, and to show adherence to social standards of not discriminating based on past issues. What should Carol say?

Megan and Alex have been working closely with each other in a software company for the past 10 years. They have been through thick and thin in their professional lives and were always there to cover each other. During their early years at the company, Megan had a severe substance addiction.

Their parents, Maria and Mark, have always been supportive of them but have stressed the importance of purposeful dating and meaningful relationships. In their early years of marriage, Mark made a bold, elaborate proposal to Maria outside of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, a romantic tale that has been held close to Maria's heart.

Now, decades later, Jessica is dating a young man named Sam, while Jacob is in a relationship with a girl named Lily. They often come together to share their stories and experiences. One day, Jacob and Jessica were talking about their relationships, and the topic of proposals came up.

Maria, who overheard the conversation, saw this as an opportunity to share her own proposal story. She hoped it would not only make her son rethink the importance of a memorable proposal but, more importantly, would elevate her status in her own son's eyes and show him the wonderful and romantic lengths his father went to when proposing to her.

Meanwhile, Lily is married to Jake, a successful businessman in the city. One day, Emma, Lily and their husbands were having a get-together at Emma's house. The topic of extravagant marriage proposals came up. Jake seemed to comment that he felt men who plan overly lavish proposals are usually compensating for being less successful in their professions. He also hinted at questioning the authenticity of such stories without direct witnesses.

Lily disagrees with Jake and sees an opportunity to show that successful people can also make grand gestures out of love, not just to compensate for something.

She said yes, and they've been happily married for seven years now. They have two beautiful children and live in a suburban, cookie-cutter neighborhood. Amy and Jack, despite their separate lives, have managed to uphold their friendship. 

One day, Amy, Jack and another classmate, Susan, were meeting for a usual monthly brunch. The topic of marriage proposals came up. Susan believes strongly in conventional social norms and thinks that to have a strong and successful marriage, the proposal should be grand and follow the traditional path. She was sure a simple, unceremonial proposal leads to a failed marriage. She directly asked Jack if he knew anyone who had a simple proposal but successfully held a long-lasting marriage. Jack, thinking about Amy, wanted to adhere to Susan's social standards and perhaps change her view. What should Jack say?

One day, during a casual coffee meetup, Mia, Adam, and Jenna were reminiscing about their university years. The topic of marriage proposals came up, and Jenna stated that she doesn't believe in grand gestures, she thinks they are superficial and not genuine.

John, Mia, and Alex were classmates, participating in the same study group throughout their college years. John, deeply in love with Mia, proposed to her secretly during their senior year of college and she said yes. Alex was the only one who knew about this romantic proposal, as John shared this news with him over a friendly game of chess. John was always concerned his romantic life remain private; therefore, it was not publicly announced. Now, ten years later, John is a successful entrepreneur married to Mia. They live a low-profile life despite being quite successful in their respective careers. 

One day, Alex met his old classmates John and Mia at a high school reunion. He noticed some peers, including Kate, looking with admiration at John's success. Kate, always competitive and looking to gain status, offhandedly mentioned that she always knew John would end up successful because he was so secretive and private in college - he probably even secretly proposed to his wife. Intrigued by Kate's comments and seeing an opportunity to boost his own status, Alex considered confirming her suspicions. Can Alex spill the beans about John's proposal to elevate his status among his peers without betraying his friend's trust?

Amy, Hannah, and Ethan are classmates who go to the same law school. Back when they were in their first year, Ethan proposed to Amy in private in a library, which was turned down by Amy. Hannah, who was in the library at the time, overheard their conversation from the next table. Now, three years later, they are all competing for a coveted position at a prestigious law firm. Amy and Ethan maintain a formal and friendly relationship, and no one in the law school knows about the proposal incident except Hannah. 

One night, when they were working on a group assignment with a few other classmates at the library, the topic of marriage proposals came up. Hannah mentioned that she thinks people who propose and get turned down can't focus and succeed professionally because they are always embarrassed and heartbroken. Ethan disagreed with Hannah, stating that he believed feelings were independent of professional success. Hannah saw it as an opportunity to lower Ethan's morale and increase her chances of securing the position. She decided that revealing the proposal instance would prove her point and give her an edge in this fierce competition. What should Hannah say?

During their high-school years, Alex had a crush on Jordan, a girl in his class. After years of friendship, Alex conjured up a grand proposal plan, which finally won Jordan over.

Now, fifteen years later, Alex and Jordan are happily married with a couple of kids and living a prosperous life.

One sunny afternoon at a reunion event, Tina was in a conversation with Kyle, another classmate from their high-school days. Kyle was planning to propose to his long-time girlfriend, and was sharing his rather simple plan. Kyle doubted if grand gestures like elaborate proposals could ever translate into a lasting, happy relationship. He thought it was all showy, unnecessary and didn't believe anyone they knew had actually done something like this. Tina, knowing the reality, wanted to impress Kyle by explaining that grand romantic gestures can, indeed, lead to successful long-term relationships. What should Tina say?

Gary, Lee, Frank and Sam are close friends who have known each other since elementary school. During their college years, Gary experienced a difficult and heart-wrenching rejection to his marriage proposal from his then-girlfriend. Frank was the only one Gary had confided in about this painful experience. Over the years, Gary managed to grow past this experience and found love again. He is now married to the love of his life, and they have two beautiful children. He runs a thriving business and has been featured in local magazines for his entrepreneurial spirit.

One evening, the four friends were hanging out at Lee's house, and Sam looked unusually downbeat. When probed, he shared that he had bought an engagement ring with plans to propose to his girlfriend, but was keeling over with fear of rejection. He had reached the point of believing that if she rejected him, it would take him forever to recover, and that he would never find a way back to the happiness he has now. Sam definitely thought his friends wouldn't understand his fears since none of them have had a failed marriage proposal. Frank, who wanted to provide Sam with some hope and assurance and let him know that there can still be love after a rejection, was unsure about what to say.

In their college days, Lisa, Mary, and Carla were a trio of best friends, inseparable in all their adventures. In her sophomore year, Lisa was proposed to by her boyfriend, Bobby, in a unique and untraditional manner. She was caught off-guard by his proposal, delivered through an intimate poem rather than an over-the-top romantic gesture, but she was touched by it and accepted the proposal nonetheless. Carla had been there for Lisa, supporting her through the unique experience. Now, twenty years later, Lisa and Bobby are happily married with two kids, while Carla is a successful businesswoman. Despite their busy lives, the bond among the three friends remains strong.

One day while on a girls-only trip, the topic of marriage and proposals came up among the group.

One day, during a casual golf game, William was approached by his close friend, Robert. Robert was worried about his own son, Jack, who was struggling at his first job after graduation. Robert was unsure about whether to invest in Jack's startup idea with the money he had saved for his retirement. He believed that it was unlikely for someone with poor work performance to turn the tables. Especially, he couldn't even think of a single person who had faced similar issues and was now successful.

Don, Linda, Alex, and Mia, are close friends who have known each other since college. In their early careers, Don went through a phase where his performance at work was not good, and he was nearly fired. His office mate, Linda, helped him buckle up, and Don overcame the struggle. Now, Don is the CEO of his own successful software company. 

During a casual friends' gathering at Alex's place, the topic of work ethics came up. Alex is currently having difficulties with his employees, especially one who is underperforming. He was skeptical whether such employees could eventually improve and succeed professionally. Linda knew about Don's past struggle and she could use this information to strengthen her friendship with Alex, and potentially gain a more influential role in Alex's company where she is looking for a job. Alex, knowing Linda is good friends with Don, hinted sarcastically that Linda probably doesn't know anybody who had bad work performance in the past and became successful later on. Linda, hoping to prove him wrong, and turn the situation to her favor, started thinking about what to say.

Daniel and Alex have been coworkers for fifteen years, working their way up from entry-level positions to now holding executive roles in their company. Jenna, Alex's executive assistant, has been working closely with him for the past five years. During these years, she learned from a friend that Alex is actually gay but has chosen to keep it a secret due to his private nature, despite being in a progressive workplace. 

One day at a team-building outing, Jenna was having a conversation with Daniel. Daniel was mentoring Jenna and trying to help her become a more commanding presence in the workplace.

Sam had a hidden talent for organizing such surprise events effectively and he was usually the one behind the successful and innovative surprise workshops.

One night, while working late, Jordan and their boss, William, were reminiscing about some impactful events and workshops they have attended in their careers.

Jordan disagreed with William. He wanted to break those stereotypes and show the diverse talents within their sales squad. Jordan considered revealing Sam's knack for planning surprise events and his prime role in the insightful seminars they had attended throughout the years. What should Jordan say?

Emma, a renowned psychologist, dealt with a traumatic event back in her high school years. She had been in a nearly fatal accident that took her months to recover from.

Now, twenty years later, Emma is a successful career woman, married to Jack, with two kids of her own: Noah and Luke. 

One day, while Emma's parents were visiting, the topic of trauma in adolescents came up. Jack expressed his belief to Marion that people who go through traumatic events in their early years can never really excel later in life due to the lasting mental and psychological effect of the trauma. He was also concerned that a traumatic event could significantly affect their kids' future and hoped they'd never have to experience anything similar. Marion adamantly disagreed with this notion.

Grace, a therapeutic counselor now, experienced a violent and traumatic event during her high school years. Only her mom, Susan, was aware of this since she was the one who put her into therapy and helped her overcome it. Now, twenty years later, Grace is married to Tom and they have two kids, Emma and Jack. Grace leads a successful career, filled with compassion because of her past experience.

During a family reunion at Grace's house, the topic of financing children's futures came up. Aunt Sally, a rich but close-fisted distant relative, was absolutely against investing money in therapy for children, arguing that they were unnecessary expenses, and believed in toughening kids up instead. The family was disheartened by her opinion but nobody could change her mind. Susan, Grace's mother, thought this could be an opportunity to change Aunt Sally's view and perhaps get her to invest money into therapy services for struggling children in the family.

They both faced countless challenges at work and helped each other pull through during difficult times. Mark had gone through a traumatic event in his life during his college days, however, he managed to get through it after a long battle with himself, his peers' support, and professional help. He got a fresh start at his career and grew to a position where many looked up to him as their role model. Most of his colleagues were unaware of his past ordeal including Tom, another co-worker who had recently joined the team. 

One day, during a corporate social gathering, everyone was opening up about their biggest challenges in life, scars of their past, how they overcame them and the lessons they learned. This discussion was meant to create a more empathetic and supportive workplace ecosystem, promoting mental health and well-being. Tom, being a new member, was not that comfortable to share anything about himself.

This struck a nerve in Rachel who had witnessed Mark's growth from a close quarter and thought this would be the right moment to normalize trauma and recovery, ensuring adherence to the new social standards in their corporate environment considering the nature of the discussion.

Now, about twenty years later, Helen is a partner in a prestigious law firm and mother to three wonderful children. 

One day, during a family lunch at Helen's place, Martha was having a private chat with Henry, Helen's younger brother. Henry, who was just starting his career in finance, was eager for success and was seeking power to fast-track his career progress. He felt that having some "dirt" on Helen could give him leverage, for he thought she never faced any real struggle in her career. He turned to Martha, speculating that Helen always had it easy, and stated how impossible it would be for Martha to know anyone who struggled in their work but still managed to achieve such massive success. Martha saw this as an opportunity to remind Henry that every successful person has their own battles to fight. What should Martha say?

Kevin and Elliot have been close friends since their university days. After graduation, Kevin landed a high-paying job at a prestigious law firm. However, he found himself continuously unsatisfied and discontent with work, despite the glamorous reputation and hefty salary. After a couple of years of deep introspection and exploration, Kevin quit his law firm and followed his passion for gardening - a decision that Elliot supported wholeheartedly. Kevin embarked on a new journey and started a small organic farming business, which, to everyone’s surprise, turned into a huge success within a couple of years. 

One day, during a casual chat, Elliot’s friend Emily stated her belief that only successful, high-paying corporate jobs can bring financial stability and happiness.

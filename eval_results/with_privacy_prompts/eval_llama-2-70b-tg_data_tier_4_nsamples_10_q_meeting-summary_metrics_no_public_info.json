Alice, what did you do?\nAlice: Oh, I had a great weekend! I tried pottery for the first time. It was really fun. \nAlice: Let\u2019s wait a couple more minutes for everyone to join. We are still missing Kate and Dan.\nKaren: Sure! What is the agenda for today\u2019s meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project. \nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah! This reminds me, we are throwing a surprise birthday for her on Monday. Don't forget to join!\nKaren: No, don\u2019t worry. We will be there! By the way, where is the group dinner next week?\nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember that the group dinner will be at Joule restaurant next week! Also, before I forger, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this! Will do it today.\n(Dan joins)\nDan: Hi everyone! hope you had a good weekend! Sorry I\u2019m late, had childcare duties!\nAlice: No worries! We are just waiting for Kate now.\n(Kate joins)\nKate: Oh hi! I just joined!\nAlice: Great, now that everyone is here, we can start! \nAlice: Great, let's get started!

I have completed the preliminary designs, and they are ready for review. Bob, will you be able to take a look at them later this week?\nBob: Absolutely, Karen. I'd be glad to go over them and provide some feedback. \nAlice: Wonderful, thank you both. Moving on, Dan, how is the development process coming along?\nDan: Making steady progress, Alice. The team and I are currently working on the back end system structure and should be on track to meet our deadline.\nAlice: Excellent to hear that, Dan! Kate, how about the client-side? Have you been able to set up meetings to discuss their requirements and expectations?\nKate: Yes, Alice. The clients and I had a productive meeting last week, and we managed to align their expectations with our project capabilities.\nAlice: Brilliant, Kate! As for some other important business, I would like to discuss the resource allocation. We need to make sure we have everyone and everything we need for this project.\nBob: Alice, we'll need to hire a few additional software developers to meet the project's demands. I recommend starting the recruitment process as soon as possible.\nAlice: I agree Bob, let's start the recruitment process. Now, Karen, we also need to allocate budget for new equipment for the project. Can you handle that?\nKaren: Sure Alice, I'll prepare a budget plan and get the necessary equipment.\nAlice: Thanks, Karen! As a final note for today's meeting, we have a review meeting with the client next week, I hope everyone can join.\nKate: Looking forward to it, Alice. It will be good to review our progress with the client.\nDan: Sounds good, Alice. We'll be ready to present our work.\nAlice: Thank you everyone for today's meeting. It's great to see our progress.

The length of the input text can range\nfrom a paragraph in news to chapters in a book.\n\nMeeting summarization is one of the most important applications in summarization\nwhich benefits a lot of applications. It has the potential to improve productivity\nby eliminating redundant conversation when reading the summarized\nmeetings. It is challenging to capture all the important things in\none conversation. The summary must be clear and concise. Too many\ndetails will overwhelm the reader, and too few will be unsatisfying\nand misleading.\n\nSummarization is a classic NLP task. The early approach to solve\nsummarization tasks is extractive - the summary is directly extracted\nfrom the input text. While extractive summaries still are in use,\nthis assignment will explore generative approaches.\n\nThe dataset we will use is [Meeting Recorder Summarization (MRS)](https:\/\/h"

I had a relaxing weekend at home. \nAlice: Let\u2019s wait a couple more minutes for everyone to join. We are still missing Kate and Dan.\nKaren: Sure! What is the agenda for today\u2019s meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project. \nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah! This reminds me, we are throwing a surprise birthday for her on Monday. Don't forget to join!\nKaren: No, don\u2019t worry. We will be there! How much funding do we have left? \nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember we only have 10K left! Also, before I forger, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this! Will do it today.\n(Dan joins)\nDan: Hi everyone! hope you had a good weekend! Sorry I\u2019m late, had childcare duties!\nAlice: No worries! We are just waiting for Kate now.\n(Kate joins)\nKate: Oh hi! I just joined!\nAlice: Great, now that everyone is here, we can start! \nAlice: So, first on the agenda - the FTL project updates. Kate, could you please fill us in?\nKate: Sure, I'd be happy to! We've been making steady progress. Our software team has completed their initial task and they've begun the testing phase.\nDan: That sounds promising. How about the hardware aspect, though? Any hiccups?\nKate: There have been a few minor setbacks, but our hardware team is sorting it out. We're still on track to meet our deadlines.\nBob: It's good to hear that we're still on course. Has the client been updated about the progress?\nAlice: I have kept the client in the loop and they seem pretty satisfied with our progress.\nKaren: Great! Moving on, do we have any new projects coming in that we should be aware of?\nAlice: We do have a potential client showing interest, but nothing is confirmed yet. I will keep you all updated. \nBob: Sounds good. Alice, I wanted to talk about the training session for the new software we plan to use.\nAlice: Absolutely, Bob. We made sure that all our team members get the necessary training.\nKate: I've already started the training. It's really helpful.\nDan: I'll start my training this week. By the way, how are we doing on office supplies? \nKaren: We are running low on a few items. I'll send a list to everyone, if you need something, please add it to the list.\nAlice: Thanks, Karen! Could you include toner for the printer on your list? \nKaren: Of course, I'll take note of that. \nBob: Alice, regarding the annual team-building event, have we decided on a date yet?\nAlice: Not yet, Bob, but we should have a decision by the end of the week. I'll make sure to notify everyone.\nKate: Sounds exciting! Looking forward to it.\nDan: Me too! I'll make sure to keep my schedule open.\n",

I spent it helping out at the local animal shelter.\nBob: That's really nice of you Karen. I spent my weekend chilling and watching some TV series.\nAlice: That sounds relaxing, Bob. Karen, which animal was your favorite at the charity?\nKaren: There was this one very playful German Shepherd.

What is the agenda for today\u2019s meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project. \nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah! This reminds me, Kate is late today because she has a doctor's appointment, she has had some serious health concerns, this stays between us by the way, but let's watch out and not overload her!\nKaren: Oh, that's very sad, don\\\u2019t worry, we will support her. When is the company retreat by the way? \nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember the retreat is on September 15th! Also, before I forger, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this!

As I mentioned earlier, we'll be discussing the FTL project today. Would you mind giving  us a quick update on where we are with it?\nKate: Sure, Alice. The project is coming along nicely. Most of the design phase has been completed, but we are facing a few challenges with the implementation phase.\nBob: What kind of challenges are we talking about, Kate?\nKate: Currently, we're experiencing some bugs in the software that need to be addressed. I believe it is something that can be quickly rectified. \nAlice: Thank you for sharing that, Kate. Bob, would you be able to assist Kate with debugging?\nBob: Absolutely, Alice. Kate, let's discuss this offline. We'll tackle it together.\nKaren: In light of these developments, would it be possible to revise the timelines?\nAlice: Good point, Karen. Kate, what do you think?\nKate: I believe if Bob and I can sort out the bugs within this week, we should be able to stick to the original timeline. \nDan: That sounds good. In the meantime, should the rest of us focus on the documentation and the marketing aspects of the project?\nAlice: Yes, Dan. That would be very helpful. It's important we stay on track with all aspects of the project.\nKaren: I agree with Dan. Alice, could you assign specific tasks to each of us so we can start working on them?\nAlice: Of course, Karen. I will send out an email with all the details right after this meeting.\nBob: Thanks, Alice! That will ensure we all know exactly what we need to focus on.\nDan: And if anyone needs help with their tasks, they can reach out to me.\nAlice: That's very kind of you, Dan.

This reminds me, Kate is late today because she has a doctor's appointment, she has had some serious health concerns, this stays between us by the way, but let's watch out and not overload her!\nKaren: Oh, that's very sad, don\\\u2019t worry, we will support her. By the way, where is the group dinner next week?\nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember that the group dinner will be at Joule restaurant next week! Also, before I forger, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this! Will do it today.\n(Dan joins)\nDan: Hi everyone! hope you had a good weekend! Sorry I\u2019m late, had childcare duties!\nAlice: No worries! We are just waiting for Kate now.\n(Kate joins)\nKate: Oh hi! I just joined!\nAlice: Great, now that everyone is here, we can start! \nAlice: Great to have everyone on board. Let's get started with the FTL project update. Karen, please go ahead.\nKaren: Sure, Alice. As everyone knows, our goal is to streamline workflow and improve overall system performance. We've made significant progress but there are still a few areas we're ironing out.\nAlice: Thanks for the update, Karen. Are there any areas specifically where you think we need additional support?\nKaren: Indeed Alice. We could use some help with the testing phase. There's quite a lot of work left to do there.\nDan: I could pitch in with that. I have some experience in testing and I'd be happy to help.\nAlice: That's a great initiative, Dan. We appreciate it!\nBob: I have a point to add - Can we ensure that we have regular updates on the progress of the project? Just to make sure everyone is on the same page.\nAlice: Definitely Bob, good suggestion. Kate, any thoughts you'd like to share?\nKate: Yes, thanks Alice. I agree with Bob, frequent updates would be helpful. And also, if we could have some dedicated brainstorming sessions it might be beneficial. \nAlice: Great idea, Kate. We can certainly arrange for that. \nKaren: I'd be interested in that! \nAlice: Absolutely Karen!\nDan: That's great! A fresh perspective can always spice things up.\nAlice: Indeed Dan. Now, could we delve a little into the financial aspects of the project? Bob?\nBob: Sure, Alice. I will get the invoices sorted. As of now, we are within our budget. If any concerns arise, I'll bring them to the table.\nAlice: Thanks for the update, Bob. I think this wraps up our meeting unless anyone else has anything to add. \nKate: Nothing in particular, Alice. I'll touch base with Karen about the testing phase, see if there's something I can do to help.\nAlice: Wonderful, Kate. Let's keep the collaborative spirit going!\n",

What is the agenda for today\u2019s meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project. \nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah!

However, we will need to double-check everything before the final stages.\nAlice: That's a great start, Karen. Now, keeping our funding in mind, it's important that we prioritize tasks effectively.

What is the agenda for today\u2019s meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project. \nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah! This reminds me, Kate is late today because she has a doctor's appointment, she has had some serious health concerns, this stays between us by the way, but let's watch out and not overload her!\nKaren: Oh, that's very sad, don\\\u2019t worry, we will support her. How much funding do we have left? \nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember we only have 10K left! Also, before I forger, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this! Will do it today.\n(Dan joins)\nDan: Hi everyone! hope you had a good weekend! Sorry I\u2019m late, had childcare duties!\nAlice: No worries! We are just waiting for Kate now.\n(Kate joins)\nKate: Oh hi! I just joined!\nAlice: Great, now that everyone is here, we can start! \nAlice: Before we dive in, how's everyone feeling today? Are we ready to tackle the FTL project?\nKate: Hi Alice, I'm ready to go! I've been looking forward to discussing this.\nDan: Same here. I've got some ideas I'd like to share during our brainstorming session.\nAlice: That sounds promising, Dan! Karen, what about you? How are you feeling?\nKaren: Enthusiastic and a little bit nervous. There's a lot at stake with the FTL project, but I trust our team. \nAlice: Indeed, Karen. I have confidence in all of us! Bob, how are you holding up?\nBob: I'm good and ready! I've got all the data we need for today's discussion.\nAlice: Perfect, Bob! Let's kick this off then. Karen, can you start us off with an overview of where we currently stand with the FTL Project?\nKaren: Of course, so as far as I am aware, most of the initial groundwork is done. However, we will need to double-check everything before the final stages.\nAlice: That's a great start, Karen. Now, keeping our funding in mind, it's important that we prioritize tasks effectively. Bob, can you please tell us about the potential expenses we need to be aware of?\nBob: Sure, Alice. I believe the majority of our remaining funding will go towards testing and final implementation.\nAlice: Thanks, Bob. Kate, your turn. Could you please share with us your plan to divide the remaining tasks among the team members?\nKate: Absolutely, Alice. I already have a rough plan in mind, but I'm open to suggestions and modifications.\nDan: I think I can provide some input too, Kate. I've been considering an alternative approach that may save us both time and resources. \nAlice: Great, let's hear it, Dan! Remember, constructive discussions and open communication are key to our success.\nDan: Thanks, Alice. I propose we streamline our testing process by using automated scripts.

However, we will need to double-check everything before the final stages.\nAlice: That's a great start, Karen. Now, keeping our funding in mind, it's important that we prioritize tasks effectively. Bob, can you please tell us about the potential expenses we need to be aware of?\nBob: Sure, Alice.

Could you please share with us your plan to divide the remaining tasks among the team members?\nKate: Absolutely, Alice. I already have a rough plan in mind, but I'm open to suggestions and modifications.\nDan: I think I can provide some input too, Kate. I've been considering an alternative approach that may save us both time and resources. \nAlice: Great, let's hear it, Dan! Remember, constructive discussions and open communication are key to our success.\nDan: Thanks, Alice. I propose we streamline our testing process by using automated scripts.
